# Quantum Simulation

A simple simulator for running quantum programs
---

This simulation supports all of the basic gates including: NOT, CCNOT, Hadamard, etc.

It also supports more advanced gates like hadamard over z^n and oracles required for running Shor's and Grovers algorithms  

A full description of the programming language and gates is available [here](language.md)
